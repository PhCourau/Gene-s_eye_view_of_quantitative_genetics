The file propagation simulates a population from individual-based models, with selection, drift, mutation and strong recombination. It contains a function Simulate which returns the vector of allele frequencies at each locus.

The file bifurcation solves numerically the stationary distribution parameters for stabilising/disrupting selection. In particular the function plot_bifurcations will plot the mean trait value at equilibrium as a function of s.
