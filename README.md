The file bifurcation.py contains function Figurebif(), which will yield Figure 1 (with the pitchfork bifurcation). It relies on the file simulate_population.py to simulate the population.

The file plot_propagation_chaos contains the function Figure_propchaos() which will plot Figure 2. It relies on two other files.
The file PDE_evolution contains the function simulate_PDE which approximates with an Euler method. The file propagation.py contains the function Simulate() which generates the population.
